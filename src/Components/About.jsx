                        Life is made up of small moments like this. As the summer vanished away, where the nature dance in wonder in transition towards a winter season, we are bringing back our volunteering days back after Covid in full force to the new autumn season. For the very first time in the history of magic valley, we are welcoming yourself to manifest the desired skills, qualities to step up and be courageous to face the future with a wide range of activities we have planned for you in our jungle treat.

                        The Objective of our volunteering program is to teach and develop the person within you in our environment, where you are going to tell a different story of spirituality at the end of the year. One of healing, success, health, abundance, prosperity, love, happiness, peace, and unlimited joy. Imagine discovering a stronger morality of yourselves with a wiser perspective to all problems in your life. That is how we meant to transform every single person who will be joining the season 1 and so on.
